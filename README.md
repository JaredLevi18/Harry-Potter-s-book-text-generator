# Harry-Potter-s-book-text-generator
This is a multi-layer perceptron neural network, that it's input it's the first book of the Harry Potter books, I'm very proud that the model's output has some words that are readable. 
The loss can be lowered, but for now I'm very happy with these results. This model was created for learning pourposes, applying the batch-norm, initializing the weitghs in a better way, and using some diagnostic tools to check the goodnes of our model.
